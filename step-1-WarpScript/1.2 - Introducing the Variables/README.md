# Step-1.2: Introducing WarpScript Variables!

## Variables

As any other programming language, WarpScript implements the Variables concept. In WarpScript you can save a specific stack element in a variable (java pointer). This is done using the function [STORE](http://www.warp10.io/reference/functions/function_STORE/). 

This function expects two elements on the stack : 
- A stack element to save
- A variable name

Then to push back the element on the stack, write the variable name **precede of a $**.

Let's try it, save the following string in a variable and then push it back several time on the stack!

```

// A WarpScript string
'Hello World!'

// Save this string in Variable

// Play with the Varaible saved
```

# To be continued

Great job! Let's continue with some WarpScript list manipulation in the next step.s
