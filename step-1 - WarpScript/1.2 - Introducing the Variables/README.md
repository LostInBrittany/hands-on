# Step-1.2: Introducing WarpScript Variables!

## Variables

As any other programming language, WarpScript implements the Variables concept. In WarpScript you can save a specific stack element in a variable (java pointer). This is done using the function [STORE](http://www.warp10.io/reference/functions/function_STORE/). 

This function expects two elements on the stack : 
- A stack element to save
- A variable name

Then to push back the element on the stack, write the variable name **precede of a $**.

Let's try it, save the following string in a variable and then push it back several time on the stack!

```
// A WarpScript string
'Hello World!'

// Save this string in variable


// Play with the saved variable



```

# To be continued

Great job! Let's continue with some WarpScript list manipulation in the [next step](https://github.com/helloexoworld/hands-on/tree/master/step-1%20-%20WarpScript/1.3%20-%20Manipulate%20a%20data%20list).
