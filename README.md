# hands-on
An hands-on used at differents tech conferences, such as BreizhCamp, Devoxx France and so on.

# Why?

For many years humanity has been exploring the skies, dreaming of interstellar voyages and new planetary colonies. And you, do you want to go 3h with us to discover the universe?

It turns out that NASA has a great public dataset, especially one that is used to search for exoplanets, that is, planets outside our solar system.

# What are the objectives of this tutorial?

At the end of this workshop, you will:

* Learn about [Warp10](http://warp10.io), a platform designed to collect, store and manipulate sensor data.

* learn about a NASA mission called Kepler

* learn about time-series

* Know WarpScript, a language designed to manipulate time-series

# Where to start?

To start with a short resume of WarpScript start with our first step [here](https://github.com/helloexoworld/hands-on/tree/master/step-1%20-%20WarpScript/1.1%20-%20Getting%20started%20with%20WarpScript).

To skip this WarpScript initiation and start working on the Nasa Kepler mission data start with our second step [here](https://github.com/helloexoworld/hands-on/tree/master/step-2%20-%20Kepler's%20Data/2.1%20-%20Exploring%20known%20time%20series).
