It was not enough for you, you want more WarpScript? You came at the right place hunter. This page is all about extraction a few WarpScript function that can be an help in your quest of exoplanet or any other Time series analysis! You will discover the function to establish a correlation between a series and a set of series, how to use the STL function, how to detect Outlier in a Time series, the discord function and ending with some useful function to compute statistics on Time series. 

Those functions are listed here to give you an hint of the richness of WarpScript and about what can be quickly tried. At any time, feel free to skip this section to try to hack our code in the([next step ](/step-7-Strong-enough-to-break-our-code)).
